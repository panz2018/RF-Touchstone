## Overview

RF-Touchstone provides a complete solution for working with S-parameters and other network parameters in JavaScript/TypeScript environments. This library allows you to:

- Read and parse Touchstone files (.s1p, .s2p, .s3p, etc.)
- Manipulate network parameter data
- Write data back to Touchstone format
- Convert between different parameter representations (RI, MA, DB)

## What is a Touchstone File?

Touchstone files are an industry-standard ASCII text format for representing network parameters of electrical circuits. Each file contains:

- Comments (lines starting with !)
- Option line (starts with #) specifying frequency units, parameter type, and data format
- Network parameter data organized by frequency points

RF-Touchstone currently supports versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the Touchstone specification.

## Key Features

- Full support for Touchstone file format (v1.0 and v1.1)
- Parameter type support: S, Y, Z, G, H
- Format conversions: RI (Real/Imaginary), MA (Magnitude/Angle), DB (Decibel/Angle)
- TypeScript implementation with strong typing
- Comprehensive test suite
- Published on NPM: [rf-touchstone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rf-touchstone)

## Installation

```bash
npm install rf-touchstone
# or
yarn add rf-touchstone
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Touchstone } from 'rf-touchstone'

// Read from a URL (nports automatically determined from .s2p)
const touchstone = await Touchstone.fromUrl('https://example.com/device.s2p')

// Or from a File object (e.g., from a file input)
const touchstoneFromFile = await Touchstone.fromFile(file)

// Or from a raw text string
const touchstoneFromText = Touchstone.fromText(fileContent, 2)

// Access data
console.log(touchstone.frequency.f_scaled)
console.log(touchstone.matrix)

// Write back to Touchstone format
const newContent = touchstone.writeContent()
```

## Online Demo

Experience the library in action with our [Touchstone Converter (React)](https://panz2018.github.io/RF-Touchstone/examples/react/index.html). It allows you to:

- Load local or remote `.snp` files
- Inspect metadata and network data
- Convert formats and units on the fly
- Download modified Touchstone files

## Examples

This repository includes examples to demonstrate the usage of `rf-touchstone` in different contexts.

- **[React Example](https://github.com/panz2018/RF-Touchstone/tree/main/examples/react)**: A complete web application (using Vite and TypeScript) that showcases how to build a Touchstone file viewer/converter.
